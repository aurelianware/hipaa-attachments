# ECS ValueAdds277 Example Responses

## IMPORTANT: Synthetic Test Data

**ALL DATA IN THESE EXAMPLES IS INTENTIONALLY FAKE AND SYNTHETIC**

These example files contain no real Protected Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). All values are carefully designed test data:

### Test Data Patterns

- **Member IDs**: Use `MEMTEST` prefix (e.g., `MEMTEST00001`, `MEMTEST00002`)
- **NPIs**: Use `9999` prefix for clearly synthetic values (e.g., `9999999990`, `9999555001`)
- **Names**: Use common placeholder names (Doe, Smith, Johnson)
- **Dates**: Use dates in 2024 timeframe for current examples
- **Addresses**: Not included in these examples
- **Phone Numbers**: Not included in these examples

### Purpose

These examples demonstrate the ValueAdds277 enhanced response format for different claim scenarios:

1. **ecs-valueadds277-paid-claim.json** - Fully paid claim with complete financial breakdown
2. **ecs-valueadds277-denied-claim.json** - Denied claim with appeal eligibility
3. **ecs-valueadds277-pending-claim.json** - Pending claim awaiting documentation

### Security Compliance

These files are designed to:
- ✅ Pass HIPAA compliance checks
- ✅ Avoid any real PHI/PII
- ✅ Provide realistic structure for testing and documentation
- ✅ Use patterns that clearly indicate test data

If a security scanner flags these files, it is a false positive. The patterns used are:
- Explicitly synthetic (MEMTEST, 9999 prefixes)
- Documented as test data
- Compliant with HIPAA testing guidelines
