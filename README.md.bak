## AI-Assisted Development

Contributors: Install GitHub Copilot in VS Code. Prefix code blocks with detailed comments like ‘// Implement [feature] with [constraints]’. Review AI-generated code for security and compliance—never commit secrets. Run ‘npm test’ before submitting PRs.  
All output must remain HIPAA-safe—redact PHI, never log confidential info, and validate AI completions before merging.
