# Cold Call Scripts for HIPAA Attachments Platform

## Script 1: Initial Discovery Call (Gatekeeper)

**Goal:** Get past the gatekeeper and reach the decision maker

**YOU:** "Hi, this is [Your Name] from HIPAA Attachments Platform. I'm trying to reach the person who handles EDI processing or claims operations. Who would be the best person to speak with?"

**GATEKEEPER:** "What is this regarding?"

**YOU:** "We work with healthcare payers to automate their 275 attachment processing through Availity. I wanted to have a brief conversation about how we've helped similar organizations reduce processing time by 80%. Who handles that at your organization?"

**GATEKEEPER:** "That would be [Name/Title]. Let me see if they're available."

**OR**

**GATEKEEPER:** "They're not available. Can I take a message?"

**YOU:** "Sure. My name is [Your Name] with HIPAA Attachments Platform. My number is [Phone] and email is [Email]. I'm calling about reducing attachment processing time from hours to minutes. Could you let them know I'll follow up with an email today and try back tomorrow?"

## Script 2: Initial Call to Decision Maker

**Goal:** Qualify the prospect and schedule a demo

**YOU:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from HIPAA Attachments Platform. Do you have 3 minutes?"

**PROSPECT:** "What is this about?"

**YOU:** "I'll be brief. We work with healthcare payers like [Competitor/Similar Payer] to automate their medical attachment processing. They were spending 2+ hours per attachment with manual SFTP downloads and data entry. We reduced that to 5 minutes with full automation."

**YOU:** "Quick question: Are you currently processing 275 attachments through Availity?"

**PROSPECT:** "Yes, we are." **[If NO, ask: "Are you handling attachments through another clearinghouse or process?"]**

**YOU:** "Got it. And roughly how many attachments do you process monthly?"

**PROSPECT:** "About [X] per month."

**YOU:** "Perfect. So at 2 hours per attachment, that's [X × 2] hours of staff time monthly. At $50/hour, that's [X × 100] per month in operational costs, or about [X × 1,200] annually."

**YOU:** "We automate the entire workflow—SFTP polling, X12 decoding, claim matching, and integration with your claims system. Most payers see an 80% reduction in processing time and save around $180K annually."

**YOU:** "Would it make sense to schedule a quick 15-minute demo so you can see how this would work for your organization?"

**PROSPECT:** "Maybe. Send me some information first."

**YOU:** "Absolutely. I'll email you a one-pager with case studies and ROI data. Can I follow up with a call on [Day] to answer any questions?"

**PROSPECT:** "Sure."

**YOU:** "Perfect. And just to make sure I send relevant information—what claims system are you using? QNXT, FacetsRx, or something else?"

**PROSPECT:** "[Claims System]"

**YOU:** "Great. I'll include specific integration examples for [Claims System]. Talk to you on [Day]. Thanks, [Name]!"

---

## Script 3: Objection Handling - "We Already Have a Process"

**PROSPECT:** "We already have a process for handling attachments."

**YOU:** "That's exactly why I'm calling. Most payers do have a process, but it's typically manual. Let me ask—when a 275 comes in through Availity, how long does it take from file download to having it linked to a claim in your system?"

**PROSPECT:** "I'm not sure exactly..."

**YOU:** "No worries. In our experience, it's usually 1-3 hours when you include SFTP login, file download, manual data entry, claim lookup, and linking the attachment. Sound about right?"

**PROSPECT:** "Yeah, probably."

**YOU:** "And that's with no errors or issues. If there's a problem—wrong format, missing claim number, etc.—it can take even longer. What we do is automate that entire workflow. The 275 file is automatically pulled from SFTP, decoded, matched to your claim, and linked—all in about 5 minutes with no manual intervention."

**YOU:** "Would it be worth 15 minutes to see how we've done this for [Similar Payer]? They were skeptical at first too, but they're now processing 500+ attachments monthly with just a couple hours of oversight instead of 1,000 hours of manual work."

---

## Script 4: Objection Handling - "Too Expensive"

**PROSPECT:** "How much does this cost?"

**YOU:** "The platform is $10,000 per year with a one-time implementation fee of $15,000. So your first-year investment is $25,000."

**PROSPECT:** "That seems expensive."

**YOU:** "I totally understand. Let's look at the ROI. You mentioned you process about [X] attachments per month. At 2 hours per attachment, that's [X × 2] hours monthly, or [X × 24] hours annually."

**YOU:** "At a conservative $50 per staff hour, that's [X × 1,200] per year in operational costs for manual processing. With our platform, you'll reduce that by 80%, saving [X × 960] annually."

**YOU:** "So your return is [Savings / 25,000]x in the first year, and [Savings / 10,000]x every year after. That's not even counting the reduction in errors, compliance risk, or faster claim adjudication."

**YOU:** "And here's the best part—we guarantee the ROI. If you don't save at least $25,000 in the first year, we'll refund your money. Fair?"

**PROSPECT:** "Okay, that makes sense."

**YOU:** "Great! Can we schedule a 15-minute demo so you can see exactly how this would work for your organization?"

---

## Script 5: Objection Handling - "No Budget"

**PROSPECT:** "We don't have budget for this right now."

**YOU:** "I understand. When does your next budget cycle open up?"

**PROSPECT:** "[Month/Quarter]"

**YOU:** "Perfect. A lot of our customers tell me they wish they had this information during their planning process. What I'll do is send over an ROI analysis and case study so you have the data you need when building your budget."

**YOU:** "And just to help you with that—what would be most valuable for your budget request? Cost savings data? Compliance benefits? Operational efficiency metrics?"

**PROSPECT:** "Probably cost savings."

**YOU:** "Got it. I'll send you a detailed ROI calculator that you can customize with your exact volume and costs. And if you'd like, I can join your budget planning meeting to present the business case and answer questions. Would that be helpful?"

**PROSPECT:** "Maybe. Let me see the materials first."

**YOU:** "Absolutely. I'll email that over today. And I'll follow up in [Month before budget cycle] to see if you'd like to discuss further. Sound good?"

---

## Script 6: Objection Handling - "Too Busy Right Now"

**PROSPECT:** "This sounds interesting, but we're in the middle of [project/initiative] right now."

**YOU:** "I completely understand. When do you expect [project] to wrap up?"

**PROSPECT:** "Probably [Month]."

**YOU:** "Okay, so [Month + 1 month] would be a better time to revisit this?"

**PROSPECT:** "Yes, that would be better."

**YOU:** "Perfect. I'll make a note to reach back out in [Month]. In the meantime, I'll send you a quick one-pager so you have it on file. And if anything changes and you want to discuss sooner, just shoot me an email."

**YOU:** "One quick question before I let you go—when you do revisit this, will you be the primary decision maker, or should I include anyone else in the conversation?"

**PROSPECT:** "I'll probably involve [Title/Department]."

**YOU:** "Great, I'll make a note of that. Thanks for your time, [Name]. I'll be in touch in [Month]!"

---

## Script 7: Scheduling the Demo

**PROSPECT:** "Okay, I'd like to see a demo."

**YOU:** "Excellent! I have a few slots available this week. Would [Day 1] at [Time] or [Day 2] at [Time] work better for you?"

**PROSPECT:** "[Day 2] works."

**YOU:** "Perfect. I'll send a calendar invite with a video conference link. The demo will be about 15-20 minutes, and I'll show you:"

**YOU (checklist):**
- "How the platform automatically processes 275 attachments"
- "Integration with [Their Claims System]"
- "HIPAA compliance features"
- "ROI specific to your volume"

**YOU:** "Should I include anyone else from your team? IT, compliance, operations?"

**PROSPECT:** "Maybe IT."

**YOU:** "Great. Can you send me their email, or should I just send the invite to you and you can forward it?"

**PROSPECT:** "I'll forward it."

**YOU:** "Perfect. And just so I can prepare a relevant demo—what's your current biggest pain point with attachment processing? Speed, accuracy, compliance, or something else?"

**PROSPECT:** "[Pain Point]"

**YOU:** "Got it. I'll make sure to focus on that. Looking forward to the demo on [Day]!"

---

## Script 8: Following Up After No Response

**Goal:** Re-engage a prospect who didn't respond to email or voicemail

**YOU:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from HIPAA Attachments Platform. I left you a voicemail and sent an email last week about automating your attachment processing, but I wanted to try you one more time."

**YOU:** "I don't want to be a pest, so I'll make this the last call. But I did want to mention one thing—we just onboarded [Similar Payer], and they're seeing exactly the results we discussed: 80% reduction in processing time and about $180K in annual savings."

**YOU:** "If this is something you'd like to explore, just shoot me a quick email or give me a call. If not, no worries—I'll assume it's not a priority right now and I won't bother you again."

**YOU:** "Thanks, [Name]. Have a great day!"

*[Leave same message as voicemail if no answer]*

---

## Script 9: Voicemail Script

**Goal:** Leave a compelling voicemail that gets a callback

**YOU:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from HIPAA Attachments Platform. My number is [Phone Number]."

**YOU:** "I'm calling because we work with healthcare payers to automate their 275 attachment processing through Availity. We've helped organizations like [Similar Payer] reduce processing time from 2 hours per attachment to about 5 minutes."

**YOU:** "If you're processing attachments manually and would like to see how we can save you 80% in operational costs, give me a call back at [Phone Number]. Or I can send you a quick one-pager via email—my address is [Email]."

**YOU:** "Thanks, [Name]. Again, my number is [Phone Number]. Talk soon!"

---

## Script 10: Demo Call - Opening

**Goal:** Set the stage for a successful demo

**YOU:** "Hi [Name], thanks for joining! Can you hear me okay?"

**PROSPECT:** "Yes, all good."

**YOU:** "Perfect. Before I jump into the demo, I want to make sure we use our time well. You mentioned [pain point they mentioned]. Is that still the top priority, or has anything changed?"

**PROSPECT:** "That's still the main issue."

**YOU:** "Great. So here's how we'll spend the next 15 minutes:"
1. "Quick overview of your current process (3 min)"
2. "Platform demo focused on [their pain point] (8 min)"
3. "ROI discussion and next steps (4 min)"

**YOU:** "Sound good? And please stop me anytime if you have questions."

**PROSPECT:** "Sounds good."

**YOU:** "Perfect. So just to level-set—you're processing about [X] attachments per month, using [Claims System], and it currently takes about [X] hours per attachment. Right?"

**PROSPECT:** "Yes."

**YOU:** "Okay, let me show you how we can get that down to 5 minutes..."

*[Begin screen share and demo]*

## Objection Handling Guide

### "We're not interested."
**Response:** "I understand. Can I ask—is it because you've already solved the attachment processing challenge, or is it just not a priority right now?"

### "Send me information."
**Response:** "Absolutely. To make sure I send the most relevant information, can I ask just 2 quick questions? What claims system are you using, and roughly how many attachments do you process monthly?"

### "We need to think about it."
**Response:** "Of course. What specific concerns or questions can I help address so you have everything you need to make a decision?"

### "We're happy with our current process."
**Response:** "That's great to hear. Just curious—how long does it typically take from when a 275 attachment arrives to when it's linked to a claim in your system?"

### "Call me back in [time period]."
**Response:** "Absolutely. Just so I can be prepared when we connect, what will change between now and then that would make this a better time?"
