## Template 1: Initial Cold Email to Healthcare Payers

**Subject:** Reduce Attachment Processing Time by 80% with Automated EDI Platform

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] processes medical attachments through Availity, and I wanted to share how we've helped similar payers reduce attachment processing time from hours to minutes.

**The Challenge:**
Most payers manually process 275 attachment requests, resulting in:
- 2+ hours per attachment (SFTP download, manual data entry, claim lookup)
- High error rates and compliance risks
- Delays in claims adjudication
- Increased provider call volume

**Our Solution:**
Cloud Health Office Platform automates the entire workflow:
✅ Automated SFTP polling and X12 decoding
✅ Direct integration with your claims system (QNXT, FacetsRx, etc.)
✅ Real-time processing with complete audit trails
✅ 100% HIPAA compliant (Premium Key Vault, private endpoints, PHI masking)

**Results:**
- 80% reduction in processing time
- 60% fewer provider calls
- $180K+ annual savings per payer
- 18x ROI in first year

**Next Step:**
Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see how this could work for [Company Name]? I can show you the platform and share specific results from similar payers.

**Quick Question:**
Are attachment processing delays or provider call volume currently on your radar as areas for improvement?

If so, let's schedule a brief 15-minute call. If not, no worries—I'll check back in a few months.
